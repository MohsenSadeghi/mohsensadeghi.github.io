	About IBMD
</p>

<p class = "Info_Text">
	The <b>IBMD</b> (In-Browser Molecular Dynamics) is a web application that performs Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations and shows the
	results in real-time (in the computational sense of the word), all inside a standard web browser.
	The details of this particular simulation case are given in the following sections. <br /><br />
	The IBMD lets you see physical and thermodynamic properties of the simulated system as the simulation progresses.
	The web application relies on Javascript for doing the necessary computations and employs HTML5 capabilities for presentation.
	The processes are all client-side and they use your computer's, tablet's, or phone's CPU.
	The simulation has no server-side computational cost. So, feel free to continue the simulation for as long as you like!

	Simulation box
</p>

<p class = "Info_Text">
	The simulation box consists of 225 <b>argon</b> atoms placed in a 2-dimensional square with sides 20 nm in length.
	argon atoms are initially positioned on an ordered lattice and given the same speed with random moving directions.
	<a class = "Info_Link" href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_boundary_conditions" target = "_blank">Periodic boundary conditions</a>
	are applied in the X and Y directions. The minimum image convention is used to handle the periodic images
	in calculating interaction energies and forces.

<p class = "Info_Subtitle">
	Statistical ensemble
</p>

<p class = "Info_Text">
	The simulation is carried out in the 
	<a class = "Info_Link" href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcanonical_ensemble" target = "_blank">microcanonical</a>
	or <b>NVE</b> ensemble, which means that the number of particles (N),
	the volume of the system (V), and the total energy (E) are constant. 
</p>

<p class = "Info_Subtitle">
	Interactions
</p>

<p class = "Info_Text">
	<a class = "Info_Link" href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lennard-Jones_potential" target = "_blank">Lennard-Jones 6-12</a>
	potential function is used to model the pair-wise interactions of argon atoms.
	The parameters of the potential (Epsilon and Sigma) are taken from information provided by this 
	<a class = "Info_Link" href = "http://www.sklogwiki.org/SklogWiki/index.php/argon" target = "_blank">SklogWiki page</a> on argon.<br /><br />
	No cut-off other than what is forced by the minimum image convention is used.

	Time integration
</p>

<p class = "Info_Text">
	Equations of motion are integrated using the velocity Verlet algorithm. You can learn more about this algorithm from this
	<a class = "Info_Link" href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verlet_integration" target = "_blank">Wikipedia page</a> on Verlet integration.<br /><br />
	A relatively large timestep of <b>20 fs</b> is used for time integration, so in order to to maintain the
	stability of the simulated system, an upper limit of ~800 K is put on the temperature that can be achieved
	through controls.

<p class = "Info_Subtitle">
	Output
</p>

<p class = "Info_Text">
	To the right of the page, you see an animated output showing the positions of particles in the simulation box. The particles are
	illustrated by circles with	radii equal to the actual van der Waals radii of argon atoms. A small scale-bar at the lower left
	corner of the picture shows the scale at which you are seeing the simulation box.<br /><br />
	To the left, there is a table displaying thermodynamic properties of the system.
	Using Real-time Plot option, you can plot graphs of these properties
	versus time and see them fluctuate as the simulation progresses or as you use the controls. <br /><br />
	Real-time Plot also contains options for plotting <b>"Speed Distribution"</b> and <b>"Radial Distribution Function"</b>.
	These two graphs are plotted using values obtained by sequential sampling of simulation data, which means that the data are obtained and stored in
	each plotting step, and then averaged through time to give a smooth and reliable output. 
	So, if you choose these options, you need to wait for enough sampled data to accumulate
	and the graphs to settle on accurate mean values.

	Controls
</p>

<p class = "Info_Text">
	The simulation starts by pressing the <b>Start</b> button and stops by pressing <b>Stop</b>. You can resume a stopped 
	simulation by pressing the <b>Start</b> button agian. You can also restart a simulation, whether running or stopped, to the initial
	state by pressing the <b>Reset</b> button.<br/><br/>
	You can change temperature using <b>T ▲</b> and <b>T ▼</b> buttons. Pressing these buttons changes
	temperature by scaling the velocity vectors of a selection of the simulated particles. This method inherently disturbs
	the thermodynamic equilibrium of the system. So, after pressing these buttons, you have to wait for the system to regain
	equilibrium and the output data to become reliable. You can check this by plotting kinetic or potential energy versus time and monitoring
	the fluctuations.<br/><br/>
	You can add atoms to the simulation box at any moment by clicking on a vacant position inside the simulation box. The added atom
	is shown in a darker color. The initial speed of the added atom is set to the most probable velocity of an ideal gas atom
	at the current temperature of the system. Its direction of movement is chosen randomly. You can also remove atoms, either the 
	original ones or the ones that you have added, by clicking on them.
