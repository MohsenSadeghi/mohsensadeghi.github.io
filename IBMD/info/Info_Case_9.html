	About IBMD
</p>

<p class = "Info_Text">
	The <b>IBMD</b> (In-Browser Molecular Dynamics) is a web application that performs Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations and shows the
	results in real-time (in the computational sense of the word), all inside a standard web browser.
	The details of this particular simulation case are given in the following sections. <br /><br />
	The IBMD lets you see physical and thermodynamic properties of the simulated system as the simulation progresses.
	The web application relies on Javascript for doing the necessary computations and employs WebGL and HTML5 capabilities for presentation.
	The processes are all client-side and they use your computer's, tablet's, or phone's CPU.
	The simulation has no server-side computational cost. So, feel free to continue the simulation for as long as you like!

	Simulation box
</p>

<p class = "Info_Text">
	The simulation box consists of 25 <b>water</b> molecule on a <b>graphene</b> sheet. 
	<a class = "Info_Link" href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_boundary_conditions" target = "_blank">Periodic boundary conditions</a>
	are applied in the X, Y, and Z directions. As the graphene sheet extends in the X and Y directions to limits of the simulation box,
	the application of priodic boundary conditions makes it an infinite sheet.<br/><br/>

	The minimum image convention is used to handle the periodic images
	in calculating interaction energies and forces.
</p>

<p class = "Info_Subtitle">
	Statistical ensemble
</p>

<p class = "Info_Text">
	The simulation is carried out in the 
	<a class = "Info_Link" href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_ensemble" target = "_blank">canonical</a>
	or <b>NVT</b> ensemble, which means that the number of particles (N),
	the volume of the system (V), and its temperature (T) are constant. 
</p>

<p class = "Info_Subtitle">
	Interactions
</p>

<p class = "Info_Text">
	Interactions in this system consist of covalent bonds between carbon atoms that form the graphene sheet, intramolecular forces of water molecules and
	non-bonded water-water and water-graphene interactions. Carbon sp2 covalent bonds 
	are modeled using harmonic potentials due to bond-stretching and angle-bending. The parameters of these harmonic potentials
	are taken from the 
	<a class = "Info_Link" href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMBER" target = "_blank">
	AMBER forcefield</a>. For water molecules, the Simple Point Charge/Flexible or <b>SPC/Fw</b> model is used. 
	The parameters of the SPC/Fw potential are taken from this
	<a class = "Info_Link" href = "http://www.sklogwiki.org/SklogWiki/index.php/SPC/Fw_model_of_water" target = "_blank">SklogWiki page</a>.
	Non-bonded interactions are modeled using the 
	<a class = "Info_Link" href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lennard-Jones_potential" target = "_blank">
	Lennard-Jones 6-12</a> potential. The parameters of the Lennard-Jones potential for carbon atoms are taken from the AMBER force field.<br /><br />
	
	<b>Lorentz-Berthelot</b> mixing rule is used for crossed interactions. You may visit this 
	<a class = "Info_Link" href = "http://www.sklogwiki.org/SklogWiki/index.php/Combining_rules" target = "_blank">SklogWiki page</a>
	on different mixing rules. <br /><br />
	No cut-off other than what is forced by the minimum image convention is used.

	Time integration
</p>

<p class = "Info_Text">
	Equations of motion are integrated using the velocity Verlet algorithm. You can learn more about this algorithm from this
	<a class = "Info_Link" href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verlet_integration" target = "_blank">Wikipedia page</a> on Verlet integration.<br /><br />
	Due to the presence of strong electric interactions, a small timestep of <b>2 fs</b> is used for time integration to handle rapid molecular vibrations.
</p>

<p class = "Info_Subtitle">
	Thermostat
</p>

<p class = "Info_Text">
	In order to maintain constant temperature in the simulation, the 
	<a class = "Info_Link" href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berendsen_thermostat" target = "_blank">Berendsen thermostat</a> is used. 
	The Berendsen thermostat acts through scaling velocity vectors based on the ratio of current temperature to the setpoint temperature.

	Output
</p>

<p class = "Info_Text">
	To the right of the page, you see an animated 3D output showing the positions of particles in the simulation box. All particles are
	illustrated by spheres with	radii equal to the radii of atoms in covalently-bonded molecules.<br/><br/>
	To the left, there is a table displaying thermodynamic properties of the system.
	Using Real-time Plot option, you can plot graphs of these properties
	versus time and see them fluctuate as the simulation progresses or as you use the controls. <br /><br />
</p>

<p class = "Info_Subtitle">
	Controls
</p>

<p class = "Info_Text">
	The simulation starts by pressing the <b>Start</b> button and stops by pressing <b>Stop</b>. You can resume a stopped 
	simulation by pressing the <b>Start</b> button agian. You can also restart a simulation, whether running or stopped, to the initial
	state by pressing the <b>Reset</b> button.<br/><br/>
	You can change setpoint temperature of the thermostat using <b>T ▲</b> and <b>T ▼</b> buttons. When the setpoint temperure changes,
	the Berendsen thermostat starts adjusting the system temperature to match the setpoint value. 
	But this process takes time and you have to wait briefly for the system 
	temperature to reach the designated value. You can check this by plotting temperature versus time and monitoring
	the fluctuations.<br/><br/>
	To the left of the visual output frame, you see camera controls, up, down, pan, tilt, etc. Using these buttons, you 
	can move your viewpoint inside the scene and change the viewing angle to better see the details of the 3D simulation. Apart from these buttons,
	you can drag on the visual frame to tilt/pan the camera and use mouse wheel for forward/backward movements. There are also
	keyboard shortcuts associated with most of camera movements. Hover over each camera control buttons to see the respective keyboard shortcut.
