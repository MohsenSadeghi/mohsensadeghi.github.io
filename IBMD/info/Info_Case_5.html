	About IBMD
</p>

<p class = "Info_Text">
	The <b>IBMD</b> (In-Browser Molecular Dynamics) is a web application that performs Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations and shows the
	results in real-time (in the computational sense of the word), all inside a standard web browser.
	The details of this particular simulation case are given in the following sections. <br /><br />
	The IBMD lets you see physical and thermodynamic properties of the simulated system as the simulation progresses.
	The web application relies on Javascript for doing the necessary computations and employs HTML5 capabilities for presentation.
	The processes are all client-side and they use your computer's, tablet's, or phone's CPU.
	The simulation has no server-side computational cost. So, feel free to continue the simulation for as long as you like!

	Simulation box
</p>

<p class = "Info_Text">
	The simulation box consists of 128 <b>sodium</b> and 128 <b>chlorine</b> ions (Na⁺ and Cl⁻) in a square crystal resembling the ionic compund of NaCl.
	The crystal is placed inside a 2-dimensional square box with sides 10 nm in length.
	Ions are initially given the same speed with random moving directions.
	<a class = "Info_Link" href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_boundary_conditions" target = "_blank">Periodic boundary conditions</a>
	are applied in the X and Y directions. The minimum image convention is used to handle the periodic images
	in calculating interaction energies and forces.

<p class = "Info_Subtitle">
	Statistical ensemble
</p>

<p class = "Info_Text">
	The simulation is carried out in the 
	<a class = "Info_Link" href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_ensemble" target = "_blank">canonical</a>
	or <b>NVT</b> ensemble, which means that the number of particles (N),
	the volume of the system (V), and its temperature (T) are constant.

	<a class = "Info_Link" href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lennard-Jones_potential" target = "_blank">Lennard-Jones 6-12</a>
	potential function is used to model the pair-wise van der Waals interactions. Electric interactions between
	ions is calculated using the <a class = "Info_Link" href = "http://cps-www.bu.edu/Wasser/robert/work/node9.html" target = "_blank">Coulomb potential</a>.
	The parameters of the Lennard-Jones potential are taken from 
	<a class = "Info_Link" href = "http://catalan.quim.ucm.es/pdf/cvegapaper155.pdf" target = "_blank">this paper</a>.<br /><br />
	Lorentz-Berthelot mixing rule is used for crossed interactions. You may visit this 
	<a class = "Info_Link" href = "http://www.sklogwiki.org/SklogWiki/index.php/Combining_rules" target = "_blank">SklogWiki page</a>
	on different mixing rules.
	No cut-off other than what is forced by the minimum image convention is used.

	Time integration
</p>

<p class = "Info_Text">
	Equations of motion are integrated using the velocity Verlet algorithm. You can learn more about this algorithm from this
	<a class = "Info_Link" href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verlet_integration" target = "_blank">Wikipedia page</a> on Verlet integration.<br /><br />
	Due to the presence of strong electric interactions, a small timestep of <b>5 fs</b> is used for time integration to handle rapid vibrations and collisions.

	Thermostat
</p>

<p class = "Info_Text">
	In order to maintain constant temperature in the simulation, the 
	<a class = "Info_Link" href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berendsen_thermostat" target = "_blank">Berendsen thermostat</a> is used. 
	The Berendsen thermostat acts through scaling velocity vectors based on the ratio of current temperature to the setpoint temperature.

	Output
</p>

<p class = "Info_Text">
	To the right of the page, you see an animated output showing the positions of particles in the simulation box. The particles are
	illustrated by circles with	radii equal to the actual ion radii. A small scale-bar at the lower left
	corner of the picture shows the scale at which you are seeing the simulation box and a legend at upper right corner designates ion species.<br /><br />
	To the left, there is a table displaying thermodynamic properties of the system.
	Using Real-time Plot option, you can plot graphs of these properties
	versus time and see them fluctuate as the simulation progresses or as you use the controls. <br /><br />
</p>

<p class = "Info_Subtitle">
	Controls
</p>

<p class = "Info_Text">
	The simulation starts by pressing the <b>Start</b> button and stops by pressing <b>Stop</b>. You can resume a stopped 
	simulation by pressing the <b>Start</b> button agian. You can also restart a simulation, whether running or stopped, to the initial
	state by pressing the <b>Reset</b> button.<br/><br/>
	You can change setpoint temperature using <b>T ▲</b> and <b>T ▼</b> buttons. When the setpoint temperure changes, the Berendsen thermostat
	starts adjusting the system temperature to match the setpoint value. But this process takes time and you have to wait briefly for the system 
	temperature to reach the designated value. You can check this by plotting temperature versus time and monitoring
	the fluctuations.<br/><br/>
	You can remove ions by clicking on them. Be careful with the electric charge balance of the system!
