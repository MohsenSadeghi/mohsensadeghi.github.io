                        I am a computational scientist with a specialization in the modeling and simulation of biological processes at the mesoscopic scale.
                        My research plays a key role in quantitative integrative biology, bridging physics-based predictions with biological observables.
                        Alongside this, I'm actively engaged in the development of deep learning techniques, which enable the automated analysis of microscopy and tomography imaging data.<br/><br/>

                    Extremely detailed insights, derived from meticulous cryo-ET experiments and tomographic data analysis, effectively streamlined the construction of a computational model of the process.<br/><br/>
                    My mesoscopic simulations unveiled the kinetics of the process in clear detail, highlighted the role of membrane-curving particles mimicking synaptotagmin C2B domain, and helped test a hypothesis on how the concentration of these particles can adversely affect the docking kinetics.<br/><br/>

                    In a recent collaboration with researchers from <a href="https://www.theliulab.com">FMP Berlin</a> and <a href="https://">Charité Berlin</a>, we built a comprehensive model of the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) virion.
                    We used information from quantitative proteomics as well as cross-linking mass spectrometry to model a wide range of viral and host proteins inside the virion. 
                    Models of glycoproteins (shown in red in the image) as well as the capsid (blue-green particles in the image) are built from cryoEM and/or AlphaFold2 predictions. <br/><br/>

                    Large-scale simulations using this model lead to predictions about the role of pp150 protein in organizing the tegument proteins into a three-layer structure.<br/><br/>

                    For a while, my main research focus was on modeling membrane-involved biological processes.
                    As my main simulation tool, I developed a highly coarse-grained model of bilayer membranes.<br/><br/>
                    
                    This model mimics the mechanics of the membrane via bonded interactions, with a force field optimized against the energy density predicted by the curvature elasticity of the membrane.<br/><br/>
                    I further complemented this membrane model with a hydrodynamic coupling scheme, as detailed in my 2020<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-16424-0"><i> Nature Communications</i></a> paper.<br/><br/>
                    You can see the model in action by checking this <a href = "https://simularium.allencell.org/viewer?trajFileName=nanoparticle_wrapping.simularium">Simularium visualization</a> (by Allen Institute) of my simulation of a nanoparticle being wrapped by the membrane.<br/><br/>
                    Finally, I implemented "force field masking" to incorporate membrane-bending peripheral proteins in the model (blue particles in the movie).
                    Predictions about the interplay between flexible peripheral proteins and the dynamic membrane are the basis of several publications, including this <a href = "https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpclett.1c02954"><i>Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters</i></a> paper.<br/><br/>

                    This is a hobby project of mine from 2014. I implemented a JavaScript-based molecular dynamics code that runs in your browser and has a graphical output of the trajectory 
                    as well as numerical and plot outputs of thermodynamic properties such as pressure. All outputs are in sync and reflect the current state of the simulation. In some cases, 
                    the simulation can be tweaked by changing the setpoint temperature or pressure, and particles can be added or removed from the simulation box by simply clicking on it. <br /><br />

    <p class = "Sub_Title"> Simulation of Water inside Carbon Nanotubes</p>
    <p class = "Text"> Currently, I am working on the Monte Carlo and Molecular Dynamics simulation of water confined inside carbon nanotubes as
                        my PhD research. </p>
    <p class = "Text"> I use my own C++ codes developed for the purpose. The SPC/E water model is majorly used for the simulations. Simulations
                        are performed in several statistical ensembles (such as NVT and μVT). I am focused on the study of molecular configurations,
                        phase transitions, and equation of state of water inside carbon nanotubes.</p> <br>

    <p class = "Sub_Title"> Nonlinear Mechanical Analysis of Carbon Nanostructures</p>
    <p class = "Text"> I was involved in nonlinear mechanical analysis of carbon nanostructures (such as carbon nanotubes and graphene) as my MSc research.
                        I developed a novel structural element for mechanical modeling of carbon nanostructures based on modified Morse interatomic potential.
                        This element, which was named the hybrid atomistic-structural element (HASE) at the time, was used to model mechanical stability and buckling,
                        nonlinear vibrations, large deformations, and even electromechanical analysis of nanostructures. Further information are provided in my papers,
                        my MSc thesis, and of course, in my book. </p>
    <p class = "Text"> Simulations were performed using MATLAB codes at first. Subsequently, I started developing an independant software for the purpose using Delphi.
                        The software is still under development by other students using the HASE for mechanical analyses.</p> <br>
