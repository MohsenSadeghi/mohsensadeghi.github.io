	<p class = "Sub_Title"> Coarse-grained model of human cytomegalovirus</p>
	<p class = "Text"> In a recent collaboration, I helped researchers from <a href="https://www.theliulab.com"> Prof. Fan Liu's lab</a> to build a comprehensive model of the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) particles.<br/>
	We used information from quantitative proteomics as well as cross-linking mass spectrometry to model a wide range of viral and host proteins inside the virion. <br/>
	Models of glycoproteins (shown in red in the image) as well as the capsid (blue-green particles in the image) are built from cryoEM and/or AlphaFold2 predictions. <br/>
	The model is published as part of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41564-023-01433-8"> this <i> Nature Microbiology</i></a> paper.

	<p class = "Sub_Title"> Particle-based modeling of membranes</p>
	<p class = "Text"> My main research focus has been on modeling membrane-involved biological processes.
	As my main simulation tool, I have developed a highly coarse-grained model of bilayer membranes.<br/>
	This model mimics the mechanics of the membrane via bonded interactions, with a force field optimized against the curvature elasticity of the membrane.<br/>
	Additionally, I developed a hydrodynamics method for anisotropically coupling the membrane particles to the surrounding fluid environment.<br/>
	The combinaiton of this membrane model and the hydrodynamic coupling procedure constitutes <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-16424-0"> this <i> Nature Communications</i></a> paper.<br/>
	You can see the model in action by checking <a href = "https://simularium.allencell.org/viewer?trajFileName=nanoparticle_wrapping.simularium">this Simularium visualization</a> from the Allen Institute.<br/>
	Additionally, I have used "force field masking" to incorporate membrane-bending peripheral proteins in the model (blue particles in the movie).

	<p class = "Text"> I use my own C++ codes developed for the purpose. The SPC/E water model is majorly used for the simulations. Simulations
						are performed in several statistical ensembles (such as NVT and Î¼VT). I am focused on the study of molecular configurations,

	<p class = "Sub_Title"> Nonlinear Mechanical Analysis of Carbon Nanostructures</p>
	<p class = "Text"> I was involved in nonlinear mechanical analysis of carbon nanostructures (such as carbon nanotubes and graphene) as my MSc research.
						I developed a novel structural element for mechanical modeling of carbon nanostructures based on modified Morse interatomic potential.
						This element, which was named the hybrid atomistic-structural element (HASE) at the time, was used to model mechanical stability and buckling,
						nonlinear vibrations, large deformations, and even electromechanical analysis of nanostructures. Further information are provided in my papers,
						my MSc thesis, and of course, in my book. </p>
	<p class = "Text"> Simulations were performed using MATLAB codes at first. Subsequently, I started developing an independant software for the purpose using Delphi.
						The software is still under development by other students using the HASE for mechanical analyses.</p> <br>

	<p class = "Text">
		This is a hobby project of mine from 2014. I implemented a JavaScript-based molecular dynamics code that runs in your browser and has a graphical output of the trajectory 
		as well as numerical and plot outputs of thermodynamic properties such as pressure. All outputs are in sync and reflect the current state of the simulation. In some cases, 
		the simulation can be tweaked by changing the setpoint temperature or pressure, and particles can be added or removed from the simulation box by simply clicking on it. <br /><br />
